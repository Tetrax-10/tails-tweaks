## Installation

1. [Download this repository](https://github.com/Tetrax-10/tails-tweaks/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Copy `wallpapers` folder and `configure.sh` file to `Persistent` folder.

> [!CAUTION]
> Downloading files from the internet is not a wise option when privacy and security are your top priorities. If you really want to be secure, do not trust files from the internet; they may contain stegomalware (hidden malicious code inside a file). I recommend not trusting files from random internet users (including me). For installation, I recommend you to manually create the `configure.sh` file by copying its contents from GitHub, and download your wallpaper from trusted sites. Make sure to use [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/) to check that it is not infected.
