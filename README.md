## Installation

1. [Download this repository](https://github.com/Tetrax-10/tails-tweaks/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Copy `wallpapers` folder and `configure.sh` file to `Persistent` folder.
3. Right click on `configure.sh` and select `Run as a Program`.
4. Done ðŸŽ‰

Everytime you boot into Tails, do step 3.

#### Paranoid Installation

This method is more secure because it does not require you to clone the repository or download the image files. 
However, you will need to manually create the `wallpapers` folder and place an image file of your choice in it.

1. Open configure.sh in this GitHub repository in the browser and copy the entire contents.
2. Paste the contents into a new file called `configure.sh` in the `Persistent` folder.
3. In the Terminal, run `chmod +x configure.sh` to make the script executable.
4. Modify the script to your preferences according to the usage instructions below.
5. Run `configure.sh` to apply the changes.

## Usage

1. **Set Variables**: Edit the script to set your preferences by modifying the variables at the top. Each setting can be enabled or disabled by setting the corresponding variable to `true` or `false`.

   ```bash
   dark_mode=true
   dark_terminal=true
   change_wallpaper=true
   wallpaper_path=/home/amnesia/Persistent/wallpapers/wallpaper.jpg
   auto_sleep=true
   dim_screen=true
   disable_camera=true
   disable_microphone=true
   disable_location=true
   disable_usb_auto_mount=false
   disable_file_history=true
   set_mouse_speed=false
   mouse_speed=-0.6
   disable_wifi=false
   ```

Note that some settings are set to `false` by default. If you want to enable them, you need to set them to `true` in the script.
